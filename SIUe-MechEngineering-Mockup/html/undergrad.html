            <h3>Career Outlook</h3>
            <p id = "message">
                Mechanical engineers are concerned with generating and using energy as well as with structures and motion in mechanical systems. The program of study prepares the student to contribute to the profession by applying existing technologies to new problems, and developing new technologies to resolve existing problems. Mechanical engineers apply their knowledge and creative abilities to an array of problems, such as designing systems to operate at the bottom of the sea or in space, as well as in the unusual environments found in many industrial processes. They also examine the basic phenomena of fluid turbulence or superconductors and the characteristics of composite materials, develop earthquake-resistant nuclear power plants and other facilities, and examine alternative energy conservation techniques.
